        <p>
          I first started this one with plans to possibly 3D model designs of planes
          as for fun. But I learned a lot about plane design and the engineering behind
          single propeller aircraft.

        </div>
        <p>
          The first step was to load the blueprints and form the <b>fuselage</b>.
          So I found some blueprints online and started with a cylinder, extruding
          and scaling to fit the shape. The fuselage is the body of the plane and
          its shape is integral for the type of flight needed.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class=" images-step step">
        <div class="step-images">
          <img class="doc1" src="./images/p51d-docu/screenies/airfoil.png"></img>
          <img class="doc2" src="./images/p51d-docu/screenies/wings.png"></img>
        </div>
        <p>
          After the fuselage came the <b>wings</b>. The wings were made from a cube extruded into a simple
          airfoil shape, then extruded and molded into a wing shape. I used the mirror modifier to make
          sure it was symmetrical on both sides. The airfoil shape is a special shape that makes air move faster
          over it and slower under it, making the pressure higher on the bottom and lower on the top. Air moves
          high pressure to low pressure, and newton says every action has an opposite reaction, so the airfoil moves up
          while the air goes down generating lift.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class=" images-step step">
        <div class="step-images">
          <img class="doc1" src="./images/p51d-docu/screenies/tail.png"></img>
          <img class="doc2" src="./images/p51d-docu/screenies/tailwireframe.png"></img>
        </div>
        <p>
          After the wings, the next part I worked on was the tail or the <b>empennage</b>. The tail is also
          made up of airfoil shapes for the stabilizers. The stabilizers do just as they say, stabilize the tail
          end of the plane.
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class=" images-step step">
        <div class="step-images">
          <img class="doc1" src="./images/p51d-docu/screenies/propblade.png"></img>
          <img class="doc2" src="./images/p51d-docu/screenies/image2.png"></img>
        </div>
        <p>
          And last but certainly not least was the <b>propeller</b>. The root was an easy cylinder extruded
          and fitted with a few control loops to fit the shape, but the blades were again, extruded airfoils.
          The propellors get wider in the body though and are angled depending which direction they spin to push
          the air back and the plane forward. I made one, then copy and pasted 3 more at 90 degree angles with one
          another
        </p>
      </div>
      <div class=" images-step step">
        <div class="step-images">
          <img class="doc1" src="./images/p51d-docu/screenies/aesthetic.png"></img>
          <img class="doc2" src="./images/p51d-docu/screenies/final.png"></img>
        </div>
        <p>
          And after adding the final touches, flattening the front top of the fuselage and adding a seat to the cockpit
          the plane was done.
          For aesthetic I angled the propeller straight, but in actuality it's angled a little to the right since the
          blades
          move clockwise from the cockpit perspective. It has to do with countertorque, the slipstream of air from the
          propellers
          and P-factor, but I think it looks great as it is now. Enjoy the video!
